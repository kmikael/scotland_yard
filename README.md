# Scotland Yard in Ruby

This is a command-line model of the board game Scotland Yard written in Ruby. I aimed for the code to be as simple as possible. Mr. X and the agents both use a greedy-algorithm to play.

## Usage

You will need to have Ruby 1.9.3 installed.

To install Ruby go to [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

If you have `git` installed use

    git clone git@github.com:mkonutgan/scotland_yard.git

to install `scotland_yard`. Otherwise, you can download a zip-file of the program [here](https://github.com/mkonutgan/scotland_yard/zipball/master).

To start the program enter

	cd path/to/scotland_yard
	ruby -I lib bin/scotland_yard

at the command-prompt.

After the program has finished running, you can look at the automatically generated `log.md` to see how the game progressed.
